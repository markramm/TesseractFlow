# Wave 4: Fiction Scene Generation with Reasoning & Verbalized Sampling (GPT-5 Mini Evaluator)
# Research Question: Test if GPT-5 Mini evaluator reduces score clustering below 37.5%
#
# EVALUATOR CHANGE: DeepSeek-Chat â†’ GPT-5 Mini (OpenRouter)
# Purpose: Validate if GPT-5 Mini provides better score discrimination and reduced clustering
# Cost: 57% cheaper than Haiku 3.5 ($0.06 vs $0.14 for 40 evaluations)
