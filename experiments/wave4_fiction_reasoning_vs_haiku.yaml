# Wave 4: Fiction Scene Generation with Reasoning & Verbalized Sampling (Haiku 4.5 Evaluator)
# Research Question: Test if Haiku 4.5 evaluator shows same score clustering as DeepSeek-Chat
#
# EVALUATOR CHANGE: DeepSeek-Chat â†’ Claude Haiku 4.5
# Purpose: Validate if 0.923 quality ceiling is evaluator saturation or true model ceiling

  rubric:
    creativity:
      description: Original prose, unexpected emotional beats, fresh descriptions. Does reasoning help generate more creative content?

# Expected Learnings:
# 1. Does Haiku 4.5 show same 0.923 clustering as DeepSeek-Chat?
# 2. Can Haiku distinguish quality differences in 0.88-0.95 range?
# 3. Does Haiku produce more varied scores (no ceiling artifact)?
