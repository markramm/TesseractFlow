If you’d just stop pushing so hard for a second and actually look for it.\"  \n\n\"Middle ground. Right. Because that’s where all the great breakthroughs happen—somewhere in the safe, cozy middle. Tell me, Sarah, when has playing it safe ever gotten us anywhere?\"  \n\n\"When has reckless abandon ever gotten us anywhere but deeper into the hole? You’re so focused on the win, you’re not seeing the cost. And I’m not just talking about money.\"  \n\n\"Fine. Then let’s talk about the cost of inaction.
