## Optimal Configurations by Workflow

### 1. Fiction Scene Generation

**Quality Improvement**: +1.8% (0.845 → 0.860)

| Variable | Optimal Value | Effect Size | Contribution % |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| verbalized_sampling | none | -0.366 | 36.6% |
| reasoning_enabled | true | +0.342 | 32.1% |
| max_reasoning_tokens | standard | -0.336 | 31.0% |
| temperature | 0.5 | -0.027 | 0.2% |
| context_depth | full | +0.025 | 0.2% |

**Key Insight**: Fiction benefits from reasoning enabled but NOT extended reasoning tokens. Verbalized sampling hurts quality.

**Recommended Configuration**:
```yaml
reasoning_enabled: true
verbalized_sampling: none
max_reasoning_tokens: standard
temperature: 0.5
context_depth: full
```

### 2. Dialogue Enhancement

**Quality Change**: -2.9% decline (0.858 → 0.833)

| Variable | Optimal Value | Effect Size | Contribution % |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| temperature | 0.9 | +0.031 | 57.1% |
| max_reasoning_tokens | standard | -0.023 | 32.3% |
| context_depth | minimal | -0.009 | 4.5% |
| reasoning_visibility | visible | -0.009 | 4.4% |

**Key Insight**: Temperature dominates (57% contribution). Dialogue is sensitive to randomness. Baseline already near-optimal.

**Recommended Configuration**:
```yaml
temperature: 0.9
max_reasoning_tokens: standard
context_depth: minimal
reasoning_enabled: false
verbalized_sampling: none
```

⚠️ **Note**: Shows quality decline vs baseline - may need further tuning or different approach

### 3. Character Development

**Quality Improvement**: +19.6% (0.675 → 0.807)

| Variable | Optimal Value | Effect Size | Contribution % |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| verbalized_sampling | none | -0.064 | 36.8% |
| n_samples | 5 | +0.061 | 33.5% |
| temperature | 0.9 | +0.030 | 7.8% |
| context_depth | full | +0.025 | 5.6% |

**Key Insight**: Character development benefits strongly from multiple samples (5) but NOT from verbalized sampling overhead.

**Recommended Configuration**:
```yaml
n_samples: 5
temperature: 0.9
verbalized_sampling: none
context_depth: full
reasoning_enabled: false
```

### 4. Progressive Discovery

**Quality Improvement**: +33.0% (0.675 → 0.897) ⭐ **Best performer**

| Variable | Optimal Value | Effect Size | Contribution % |
|----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| n_samples | 3 | -0.156 | 30.7% |
| reasoning_visibility | visible | -0.152 | 29.4% |
| context_depth | full | +0.145 | 26.6% |
| max_reasoning_tokens | extended | +0.081 | 8.3% |
| reasoning_enabled | true | +0.051 | 3.3% |

**Key Insight**: Discovery benefits from reasoning with full context but fewer samples (3 vs 5).

**Recommended Configuration**:
```yaml
reasoning_enabled: true
context_depth: full
n_samples: 3
max_reasoning_tokens: extended
reasoning_visibility: visible
temperature: 0.5
```

## Cross-Workflow Patterns

### Variables That Consistently Matter

1. **verbalized_sampling**: Strong negative effect in Fiction (-36.6%) and Character (-36.8%)
   - **Recommendation**: Use `none` for most workflows

2. **n_samples**: Critical for Character (+33.5%) and Discovery (+30.7%)
   - **Recommendation**: 5 for character work, 3 for discovery/fiction

3. **reasoning_enabled**: Benefits Fiction (+32.1%) and Discovery (+3.3%)
   - **Recommendation**: Enable for creative/complex tasks, disable for dialogue

4. **temperature**: Dominates Dialogue (57.1%), helps Character (7.8%)
   - **Recommendation**: 0.9 for dialogue/character, 0.5 for fiction/discovery

### Variables With Minimal Impact

1. **reasoning_visibility**: <5% contribution except Discovery (29.4%)
2. **context_depth**: <10% except Discovery (26.6%)
3. **max_reasoning_tokens**: Varies by workflow (31% Fiction, 32% Dialogue, 2.6% Character, 8.3% Discovery)

   - -2.9% quality decline
   - Consider: DeepSeek-V3, GPT-4o-mini, or prompt engineering

3. **Validate optimal configurations** with confirmation runs:
   - Run 3-5 additional tests per workflow with recommended settings
   - Confirm quality improvements are statistically significant

4. **Document evaluator selection guidelines**:
   - When to use GPT-5 Mini vs Haiku 3.5 vs DeepSeek-V3
   - Cost-quality trade-off decision framework

### Key Learnings

1. **Evaluator choice significantly impacts**:
   - Score distribution patterns
   - Optimal variable configurations
   - Cost-performance trade-offs

2. **Different workflows have different needs**:
   - Discovery benefits from reasoning + extended tokens
   - Character benefits from multiple samples + high temperature
   - Fiction benefits from reasoning but standard tokens
   - Dialogue dominated by temperature, reasoning less helpful

3. **verbalized_sampling often hurts quality**:
   - Strong negative effects in Fiction (-36.6%) and Character (-36.8%)
   - Minimal benefit in other workflows
   - **Default recommendation**: Use `none` unless specific workflow testing shows benefit

4. **Sample count matters for quality**:
   - 5 samples optimal for character development (+33.5% contribution)
   - 3 samples optimal for discovery/fiction (avoids cost overhead)
   - Consider workflow complexity when setting n_samples

### Score Clustering Measurement

**Methodology**:
1. Extract all `overall_score` values from experiment results
2. Round to 2 decimal places (0.00-1.00 scale)
3. Count frequency of each unique score
4. Calculate max clustering % = (most_common_count / total_scores) × 100
5. Compare to 37.5% Haiku 3.5 baseline

**Baseline Comparison**:
- Haiku 3.5: 12/32 scores at 0.89 = 37.5% clustering
- GPT-5 Mini: 5/30 scores at 0.82 = 16.67% clustering
- Improvement: 55% reduction in clustering
