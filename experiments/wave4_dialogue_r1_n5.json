You’re asking us to shoulder too much.\"  \nMarcus: \"Sarah, I get it. But you’re overlooking the upside here. We’re not just handing you a deal; we’re building a partnership. Risks are part of the equation.\"  \nSarah: \"Partnership? Sure. But partnerships don’t start with one side holding all the cards. Your terms are lopsided, and you know it.\"  \nMarcus: \"Lopsided? That’s a stretch. We’re offering flexibility where it counts. You’re focusing on the wrong details.\"  \nSarah: \"The ‘wrong details’? Marcus, those details are what keep my team up at night. If you’re not willing to address them, then maybe we’re wasting each other’s time.\"  \nMarcus: \"Alright, alright. Let’s take a step back. What if we tweaked the timeline? Gave you more breathing room upfront?\"  \nSarah: \"Breathing room’s a start. But it’s not just about timing. It’s about trust. And right now, your proposal doesn’t exactly inspire it.\"  \nMarcus: \"Fair point. But trust goes both ways, Sarah. You’ve got to meet me halfway here.\"  \nSarah: \"I’m here, aren’t I? But halfway doesn’t mean bending until we break. Let’s find a middle ground that doesn’t leave us exposed.\"  \nMarcus: \"Exposed. That’s a strong word. But fine—let’s hash this out. What’s your bottom line?\"  \nSarah: \"My bottom line? A fair split on the liabilities. And transparency on the deliverables. No surprises.\"  \nMarcus: \"No surprises. I can work with that. But you’ve got to give on the milestones. We can’t have this dragging on indefinitely.\"  \nSarah: \"Agreed. But ‘indefinitely’ isn’t the same as ‘reasonable.’ Let’s define what that looks like—together.\"  \nMarcus: \"Together. I like the sound of that. Let’s draft something that works for both of us.\"  \nSarah: \"Finally. Let’s get it done.\"",

      "enhanced_raw": "\"Sarah, let’s not waste time here. You know what we’re asking for is fair.\" Marcus leaned forward, his voice steady but edged with impatience.  \n\nSarah crossed her arms, her tone calm but firm. \"Fair? Marcus, your definition of ‘fair’ seems to center on your bottom line, not the actual value we’re bringing to the table.\"  \n\nHe exhaled sharply, a flicker of frustration breaking through. \"Value? Sarah, we’ve been over this. The numbers don’t lie. You’re asking for concessions we can’t justify.\"  \n\nHer gaze didn’t waver. \"And you’re offering terms that don’t reflect the partnership we’ve built. This isn’t just about numbers, Marcus. It’s about trust.\"  \n\nMarcus leaned back, his jaw tightening. \"Trust doesn’t pay the bills, Sarah. We’re running a business, not a charity.\"  \n\nShe tilted her head, a hint of disappointment in her voice. \"Funny. I thought we were running a partnership. Maybe I was wrong.\"  \n\nHe paused, his tone softening just slightly. \"Look, I get it. You’re protective of your team. But we’re not the enemy here. We’re trying to find a middle ground.\"  \n\nSarah’s expression softened, but her resolve remained. \"Then let’s find it. But not at the expense of what we’ve worked for. That’s non-negotiable.\"  \n\nMarcus rubbed his temple, the tension in his shoulders easing a fraction. \"Alright. Let’s go over the numbers again. But this time, let’s actually listen to each other.\"  \n\nSarah nodded, a small, cautious smile breaking through. \"Agreed. Let’s try that.\"",
