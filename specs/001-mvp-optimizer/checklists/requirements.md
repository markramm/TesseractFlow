# Specification Quality Checklist: LLM Workflow Optimizer MVP

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-25
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: âœ… PASSED

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is complete, clear, and ready for `/speckit.plan`.

### Strengths:
- Clear prioritization of 3 user stories (P1, P2, P3)
- Each story is independently testable
- 15 functional requirements with specific MUST statements
- 8 measurable success criteria with quantifiable metrics
- Well-defined key entities (7 domain objects)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Clear scope boundaries (MVP vs future features)
- Technology-agnostic success criteria

### Notable Decisions Made (No Clarification Needed):
- **Variable count**: Assumed 4-7 variables for L8 (standard Taguchi DOE range)
- **Experiment duration**: Assumed 15 minutes is acceptable for code review workflow
- **Quality scoring**: Assumed rubric-based LLM-as-judge is sufficient for MVP
- **Output format**: Assumed JSON for results storage, SVG/PNG for visualizations
- **CLI interface**: Assumed command-line is appropriate for MVP (developers are target users)
- **Test strategy**: Sequential execution for MVP (parallelization future enhancement)

All assumptions are documented in the Assumptions section and represent reasonable defaults for the domain.

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- No blocking issues identified
- Constitution principles upheld (workflows-as-boundaries, multi-objective optimization, transparency)
- MVP scope is well-defined and deliverable in 3-6 months
