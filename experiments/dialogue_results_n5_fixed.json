Because from where I'm sitting, it feels like you're dragging your feet.\"  \n\nMarcus: *crosses his arms, leaning back in his chair with a half-smile.* \"Sarah, always so direct. But let’s not confuse deliberation with hesitation. Your terms—they’re... ambitious. And ambition has a price.\"  \n\nSarah: *narrows her eyes, her voice dropping just enough to edge into a warning.* \"Ambition? Or necessity? You know as well as I do this isn’t just about numbers. It’s about leverage. And right now, you’re not holding much of it.\"  \n\nMarcus: *chuckles softly, though his tone sharpens.* \"Leverage. That’s rich. You came to *me*, remember? So, let’s talk about *necessity*. Your timeline—it’s tighter than you’re letting on, isn’t it?\"  \n\nSarah: *pauses, her jaw tightening for a moment before she exhales.* \"Fine. You want honesty? Here it is. Every day this drags on costs me. But don’t mistake that for desperation. I’ll walk if I have to.\"  \n\nMarcus: *leans forward now, matching her intensity.* \"And lose everything you’ve sunk into this? Doubtful. But here’s the thing—I’m not your enemy, Sarah. I’m just asking for a little... flexibility. You give me that, and we might just find ourselves on the same page.\"  \n\nSarah: *studies him, her expression unreadable for a moment before she nods slightly.* \"Flexibility. Alright. But understand this—it goes both ways. Push too hard, and you’ll find out just how far I’m willing to go.\"  \n\nMarcus: *smirks, though there’s a flicker of respect in his eyes.* \"Noted. Let’s see if we can both walk away with something worth having.\"",
