A young scientist, Elara, discovers an ancient, sentient artifact buried beneath the surface. The artifact communicates telepathically, revealing that it was left by a long-extinct civilization as a warning: the planet is a sentient being itself, and exploitation will awaken its wrath. Elara struggles to convince the colonyâ€™s leaders, who prioritize survival and profit over her findings. As tensions rise, strange seismic activities begin, hinting at the planetâ€™s awakening. Elara must choose between aligning with the artifactâ€™s cryptic guidance or saving her people from the impending catastrophe.  \n\n**Key Themes:** Ethical dilemmas, environmental consciousness, and the clash between progress and preservation.  \n\n**Minimal Context:** Focuses on Elaraâ€™s internal conflict and the looming threat of the planetâ€™s retaliation.
