  rubric:
    technical_craft:
      description: |
        Technical prose elements that demonstrate craft mastery:
        • Sentence variety: Mix of short (5-10 words), medium (15-25 words), long (30+ words) sentences
        • Sensory detail: Specific appeals to sight, sound, touch, smell, taste (not generic)
        • POV consistency: Maintains chosen perspective without slips or camera switches
        • Paragraph structure: Varied lengths, purposeful white space, rhythm
        • Repetition: Strategic use (anaphora, motifs) vs accidental redundancy
        • Active vs passive voice: Intentional choices matching narrative intent

        Score 0-25 for each:
        0-6: Multiple technical errors, monotonous rhythm, no sensory grounding
        7-12: Basic competence but limited variety or sensory engagement
        13-18: Solid technical execution with some variety and sensory detail
        19-25: Masterful sentence variety, rich sensory detail, purposeful repetition
      scale: 0-25 points
      weight: 0.25

    show_dont_tell:
      description: |
        Ratio of showing (concrete actions, dialogue, sensory detail) vs telling (abstract summaries, explanations):
        • Character emotion shown through physical cues, not labeled ("hands trembling" not "she was nervous")
        • Setting conveyed through specific details, not generic descriptions
        • Relationship dynamics demonstrated through action/dialogue, not exposition
        • Internal state revealed through behavior, physical sensation, or filtered observation
        • Avoids unnecessary explanatory tags ("angrily", "sadly", "nervously")

        Score 0-25 for each:
        0-6: Predominantly abstract telling, frequent emotion labeling, generic descriptions
        7-12: Mix of showing/telling, some concrete detail but often explains emotions
        13-18: Primarily shows through action/detail with occasional telling for pacing
        19-25: Consistently shows through concrete, specific detail; trusts reader inference
      scale: 0-25 points
      weight: 0.30

    stylistic_consistency:
      description: |
        Coherent voice and intentional stylistic choices throughout:
        • Diction level: Matches character POV (internal monologue, education, era)
        • Figurative language: Metaphors/similes fit character worldview and tone
        • Rhythm/pacing: Sentence flow matches scene tension (staccato for action, flowing for reflection)
        • Tonal unity: Humor, darkness, lyricism maintained appropriately
        • Detail selection: What's noticed/described fits character focus and mood
        • Narrative distance: Consistent closeness/remoteness to POV character

        Score 0-25 for each:
        0-6: Inconsistent voice, jarring shifts in diction or tone
        7-12: Generally consistent but occasional mismatched metaphors or rhythm breaks
        13-18: Strong stylistic coherence with intentional variation for effect
        19-25: Seamless unity of voice, every detail filtered through consistent perspective
      scale: 0-25 points
      weight: 0.25

    scene_structure:
      description: |
        Clear scene architecture with purposeful beats:
        • Opening hook: Grounds reader in situation/conflict within first 2 sentences
        • Conflict/tension: Clear want vs obstacle driving the scene forward
        • Rising action: Escalating stakes or complications, not flat repetition
        • Turning point: Moment of change, decision, or revelation
        • Resolution/transition: Scene ends with forward momentum or emotional shift
        • Beat variety: Mix of action, dialogue, interiority, description in service of scene goal

        Score 0-25 for each:
        0-6: Meandering structure, unclear stakes, flat or missing turning point
        7-12: Basic scene shape but weak hook or unclear conflict
        13-18: Solid structure with clear arc and purposeful beats
        19-25: Masterful scene architecture, every beat serves the arc, strong momentum
      scale: 0-25 points
      weight: 0.20
