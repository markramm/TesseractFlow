This inconsistency can lead to confusion and potential issues if the iterable is not indexable. [line 40] Suggested fix: Consider using `Sequence[float]` for `qualities` to maintain consistency with `costs` and `latencies`.\n- (medium) The `normalize_metrics` method raises a `ValueError` for unsupported normalization methods, but it does not provide a list of supported methods in the error message. [line 23] Suggested fix: Update the error message to include the supported normalization methods, e.g., 'Unsupported normalization method: {method}. Supported methods: min-max'.\n- (low) The `normalize_metrics` method returns a tuple with a list of normalized values and a dictionary of min/max values. The dictionary keys are hardcoded as strings, which could lead to errors if the keys are mistyped. [line 25] Suggested fix: Consider using a named tuple or a dataclass to return the normalized values and the min/max values, which would improve readability and reduce the risk of errors.\n- (low) The docstring for `compute` mentions 'normalized cost and latency values', but the method does not perform normalization internally. This could be misleading. [line 14] Suggested fix: Update the docstring to clarify that the method expects normalized cost and latency values as inputs.\nSuggestions:\n- Consider adding input validation in the `compute` method to ensure that the input values are within expected ranges (e.g., quality between 0 and 1).\n- Add unit tests to cover edge cases, such as empty sequences, sequences with identical values, and sequences with negative values.\n- Consider adding a method to validate the `UtilityWeights` object to ensure that the weights are non-negative and sum to a reasonable value.",

The dictionary keys are hardcoded as strings, which could lead to errors if the keys are mistyped. [line 25] Suggested fix: Consider using a named tuple or a dataclass to return the normalized values and the min/max values, which would improve readability and reduce the risk of errors.\n- (low) The docstring for `compute` mentions 'normalized cost and latency values', but the method does not perform normalization internally. This could be misleading.
