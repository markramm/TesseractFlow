Because I’m not in the mood for games.\"  \n\n**Marcus:**  \n\"Games? Sarah, come on. This isn’t about games. It’s about strategy. You’re looking at the trees, and I’m trying to show you the forest. The numbers? They’re fluid. The timelines? They’re flexible. What matters is the vision. And if you’d just—\"  \n\n**Sarah:**  \n\"Vision? Vision doesn’t pay the bills, Marcus. I’ve got a team of twenty people waiting for concrete answers, and all I’m getting from you is philosophical musings. If you’re not ready to commit, just say it. Don’t waste my time.\"  \n\n**Marcus:**  \n\"Commit? I’m here, aren’t I? Sitting across from you, trying to make this work. But you’re so focused on the *how* that you’re missing the *why*. This isn’t just another project—it’s a partnership. And partnerships require trust.\"  \n\n**Sarah:**  \n\"Trust? You want to talk about trust? You’ve been dodging my calls for weeks, Marcus. Every time I ask for a status update, it’s radio silence. You don’t get to play the trust card when you’ve been ghosting me.\"  \n\n**Marcus:**  \n\"Alright, fair. I’ll own that. Things got... complicated. But I’m here now, and I’m trying to fix it. Can we just—can we reset? Start fresh? Because I think we’re both too deep in the weeds to see the bigger picture.\"  \n\n**Sarah:**  \n\"Reset? Fine. But let’s be clear: I’m not signing off on anything until I see a detailed plan. No more hand-waving, no more metaphors. Just facts. Can you give me that?\"  \n\n**Marcus:**  \n\"Facts. Right. I’ll get you the numbers, the timelines, the whole damn spreadsheet. But Sarah, promise me one thing—don’t lose sight of what we’re building here. This isn’t just about the bottom line. It’s about something bigger.\"  \n\n**Sarah:**  \n\"Bigger, huh? Alright, Marcus. I’ll bite. Show me the numbers, and I’ll keep an open mind. But if this is another one of your smoke-and-mirrors acts, don’t bother calling me back.\"  \n\n**Marcus:**  \n\"Deal. And Sarah? For what it’s worth... I’m sorry. I know I’ve been hard to pin down. But I’m in this. All in.\"  \n\n**Sarah:**  \n\"Good. Because so am I. Now let’s get to work.\"",
