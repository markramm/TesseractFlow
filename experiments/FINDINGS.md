## üîç Variable Impact Analysis

### 1. üå°Ô∏è Temperature Impact: **MINIMAL**

- **Temp 0.3 (deterministic)**: Avg Quality = 0.674
- **Temp 0.6 (balanced)**: Avg Quality = 0.681
- **Impact**: +0.007 quality improvement (+1.0%)

**Conclusion**: Temperature has negligible impact on code review quality. Either setting is acceptable.

**Recommendation**: Use 0.3 for consistency and reproducibility.

---

### 2. üí∞ Model Impact: **SIGNIFICANT** (6.5% quality improvement)

- **Haiku 4.5**: Avg Quality = 0.656
- **Sonnet 4.5**: Avg Quality = 0.699
- **Impact**: +0.042 quality improvement (+6.5%)

**Conclusion**: Sonnet 4.5 provides measurably better code review insights.

**Key Observations**:
- Sonnet achieved the highest single score (0.748 on Test #3)
- Sonnet consistently scored higher across different contexts
- 6.5% improvement is substantial for production code review

**Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
- Sonnet is ~3x more expensive than Haiku ($9/M vs $3/M tokens)
- For production-critical code: **Quality improvement JUSTIFIED**
- For routine reviews: Haiku may be sufficient

**Recommendation**: Use Sonnet 4.5 for production code review of critical modules like `rubric.py`.

---

### 3. üìÅ Context Size Impact: **MIXED**

- **File only**: Avg Quality = 0.664
- **Full module**: Avg Quality = 0.695
- **Impact**: +0.031 quality improvement (+4.7%)

**Conclusion**: Full module context provides better review quality.

**Insight**: Access to related files (metrics.py, cache.py, types.py, exceptions.py) helped reviewers understand:
- How the module integrates with the system
- Contract expectations from type definitions
- Error handling patterns across the codebase
- Caching strategy dependencies

**Recommendation**: Use full_module context for comprehensive production reviews.

---

### 4. üß† Generation Strategy Impact: **NEGATIVE** (-3.3%)

- **Standard**: Avg Quality = 0.684
- **Chain-of-thought**: Avg Quality = 0.671
- **Impact**: -0.013 quality decline (-1.9%)

**Surprising Finding**: Chain-of-thought actually reduced review quality!

**Hypothesis**: For code review tasks, direct analysis may be more effective than explicit reasoning steps. CoT might introduce:
- Verbosity that dilutes insights
- Over-thinking simple issues
- Reduced focus on concrete problems

**Recommendation**: Use standard prompting for code review. Save CoT for complex reasoning tasks.

## üèÜ Optimal Configuration

**Test #3 achieved the highest quality score: 0.748**

### Winning Configuration:
- **Temperature**: 0.3 (deterministic)
- **Model**: Sonnet 4.5 (premium quality)
- **Context**: full_module (comprehensive)
- **Strategy**: standard (direct prompting)

### Why This Configuration Wins:

1. **Sonnet 4.5** brought superior analytical depth
2. **Full module context** enabled understanding of system integration
3. **Standard prompting** kept focus sharp on actual issues
4. **Low temperature** ensured consistent, reproducible feedback

## üí° Key Insights About rubric.py

The reviews identified several real issues in `rubric.py`:

### Functionality Issues (Test #1: 0.72/1.00)
1. Assertion-based type narrowing can fail with Python's `-O` flag
2. `_extract_response_content()` fallback patterns are fragile
3. No validation that LLM-returned dimensions match requested rubric
4. Score extraction regex allows leading zeros and imprecise patterns

### Error Handling Issues (Test #1: 0.58/1.00)
1. Bare `except Exception` catches KeyboardInterrupt/SystemExit in Python <3.11
2. Silent fallbacks in content extraction mask problems
3. Missing validation for LLM response format
4. Retry logic doesn't distinguish transient vs permanent failures

### Code Quality (Test #1 noted)
- Generally well-designed with clear separation of concerns
- Good use of async/await patterns
- Effective caching integration
- Type hints present but could be more precise

### Performance (Generally good)
- Caching strategy appropriate
- Regex patterns efficient
- Minimal unnecessary LLM calls

### Testability (Could improve)
- Some methods are difficult to mock
- Retry logic hard to test in isolation
- Async methods require careful test setup

### Documentation (Generally good)
- Public APIs have docstrings
- Type hints help clarify contracts
- Could use more inline comments for complex logic

## üìà Actionable Recommendations

### For Production Code Review:
1. ‚úÖ **Use Sonnet 4.5** - Quality improvement worth the cost
2. ‚úÖ **Include full module context** - Better understanding of integration
3. ‚úÖ **Use standard prompting** - More focused than chain-of-thought
4. ‚úÖ **Set temperature to 0.3** - Consistent, reproducible reviews

### For rubric.py Improvements:
1. **Fix error handling**: Use `except BaseException` or specific exceptions
2. **Add dimension validation**: Verify LLM returns match rubric keys
3. **Improve regex patterns**: Tighten score extraction to reject invalid formats
4. **Add content extraction tests**: Ensure fallback patterns work correctly
5. **Document retry strategy**: Clarify when retries help vs hurt

## üíµ Cost Analysis

**Note**: Costs showed as $0.0000 due to caching. Actual costs based on model pricing:

### Per-Test Estimated Costs:
- **Haiku 4.5 tests**: ~$0.02-0.03 per test
- **Sonnet 4.5 tests**: ~$0.06-0.09 per test
- **Full module context**: +50% tokens vs file_only

### Total Experiment Cost (estimated):
- **7 tests completed**: ~$0.30-0.45
- **8 tests total (projected)**: ~$0.35-0.50

**Actual cost was lower due to evaluation cache hits.**
