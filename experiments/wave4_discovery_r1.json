A young scientist, Elara, discovers an ancient, sentient artifact buried beneath the surface. The artifact communicates telepathically, revealing that it was left by a long-extinct civilization as a warning: the planet is a sentient being itself, and exploitation will awaken its wrath. Elara struggles to convince the colony’s leaders, who prioritize survival and profit over her findings. As tensions rise, strange seismic activities begin, hinting at the planet’s awakening. Elara must choose between aligning with the artifact’s cryptic guidance or saving her people from the impending catastrophe.  \n\n**Key Themes:** Ethical dilemmas, environmental consciousness, and the clash between progress and preservation.  \n\n**Minimal Context:** Focuses on Elara’s internal conflict and the looming threat of the planet’s retaliation.
