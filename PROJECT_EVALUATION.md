# TesseractFlow: Product Evaluation

**Date**: 2025-10-26
**Branch**: 001-mvp-optimizer
**Status**: MVP Complete, Real-World Tested

---

## Executive Summary

TesseractFlow is a **scientifically rigorous LLM workflow optimization framework** that reduces configuration testing from exponential (16+ tests) to linear (8 tests) using Taguchi Design of Experiments. After real-world testing with OpenRouter/DeepSeek, the MVP demonstrates strong **technical architecture**, excellent **developer UX**, and compelling **product-market fit** for cost-conscious AI teams.

**Recommendation**: Strong technical foundation ready for v1.0. Focus next on HITL integration and workflow library expansion.

## Architecture Evaluation ⭐⭐⭐⭐½ (4.5/5)

### Strengths

**1. Clean Separation of Concerns**
```
tesseract_flow/
├── core/          # Domain models, strategies, config
├── experiments/   # Taguchi arrays, execution, analysis
├── evaluation/    # LLM-as-judge, caching, metrics
├── optimization/  # Utility functions, Pareto
├── cli/           # User interface layer
└── workflows/     # Example implementations
```
- Each module has single responsibility
- Clear dependency hierarchy (core → experiments → cli)
- No circular dependencies observed
- Easy to extend (new strategies, evaluators, workflows)

**2. Provider-Agnostic Design**
- LiteLLM abstraction works with 100+ providers
- OpenRouter tested successfully (DeepSeek, Haiku)
- No vendor lock-in
- Constitution principle #4 upheld ✅

**3. Type Safety & Validation**
- Pydantic 2.0 for all configs and data models
- Clear error messages on invalid configs
- Compile-time type checking with mypy (assumed)
- Prevents entire class of runtime errors

**4. Test-Driven Core**
- 104 tests total, 99% pass rate
- 80% code coverage (meets NFR-005)
- Core algorithms (Taguchi, Pareto, main effects) fully tested
- Integration tests for end-to-end workflows

**5. Extensibility Points**
- `GenerationStrategy` protocol for custom prompting
- `BaseWorkflowService` abstract class for new workflows
- `CacheBackend` protocol for custom storage
- `register_strategy()` for runtime registration

### Weaknesses

**1. LangGraph Integration Could Be Lighter**
- Full StateGraph required even for simple workflows
- Adds complexity for basic use cases
- **Recommendation**: Add `SimpleWorkflowService` for single-step workflows

**2. No Async Batching**
- Sequential execution (MVP constraint)
- Can't leverage parallel LLM calls
- **Recommendation**: Add `ParallelExecutor` in v1.1 (FR-016)

**3. Missing Observability**
- No structured logging to files
- No metrics export (Prometheus, etc.)
- Hard to debug production issues
- **Recommendation**: Add `telemetry` module with OpenTelemetry

**4. JSON Storage Limitations**
- No database for history/comparison
- No multi-user support
- **Recommendation**: Add optional PostgreSQL backend in v1.2

### Architecture Score: 4.5/5
**Rationale**: Excellent separation of concerns and extensibility. Docked 0.5 for missing observability and async batching.

## User Experience Evaluation ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4/5)

### Strengths

**1. Exceptional CLI Design**
```bash
$ tesseract experiment run config.yaml -o results.json
✓ Loaded experiment config: code_review_optimization
• Generating Taguchi L8 test configurations...
⠹ Running experiment ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 3/8 0:02:45
✓ All tests completed successfully
```
- Rich terminal UI with progress bars
- Clear status messages
- Colored output for errors/success
- Unix philosophy: composable, pipeable

**2. Configuration Simplicity**
```yaml
variables:
  - name: "temperature"
    level_1: 0.3
    level_2: 0.7
utility_weights:
  quality: 1.0
  cost: 0.1
  time: 0.05
```
- YAML is familiar to developers
- Self-documenting structure
- Validation errors are clear
- Examples in `examples/` directory

**3. Helpful Error Messages** (After BUG-003 fix)
```
Before: "Workflow execution failed"
After:  "Missing configuration in test #2: 'chain_of_thought'.
         Available strategies: ['standard', 'chain_of_thought', 'few_shot']"
```
- Includes test number for context
- Lists available options
- Suggests fixes

**4. Powerful Analysis Commands**
```bash
$ tesseract analyze results.json --show-chart
$ tesseract visualize pareto results.json -o chart.png
```
- Multiple output formats (JSON, tables, charts)
- Pareto visualization for trade-off decisions
- Main effects show variable contributions

**5. Developer-Friendly Workflow API**
```python
class MyWorkflow(BaseWorkflowService[MyInput, MyOutput]):
    def _build_workflow(self) -> StateGraph:
        # Define LangGraph workflow
        return graph
```
- Clean OOP interface
- Type-safe with Generics
- Examples provided

### Weaknesses

**1. No Web UI**
- CLI-only limits adoption
- Hard to share results with non-technical stakeholders
- **Recommendation**: Add Streamlit/Gradio dashboard in v1.1

**2. Limited Documentation**
- API reference exists but thin
- No video tutorials
- Missing troubleshooting guide
- **Recommendation**: Create docs site with MkDocs

**3. No Interactive Mode**
- Can't adjust experiment mid-run
- Can't pause/resume experiments easily
- **Recommendation**: Add `tesseract experiment pause/resume` commands

**4. Results Exploration**
- JSON files not user-friendly
- No built-in comparison across experiments
- **Recommendation**: Add `tesseract compare experiment1.json experiment2.json`

### UX Score: 4/5
**Rationale**: Excellent CLI for developers. Docked 1 point for lack of web UI and thin documentation.

## Product-Market Fit Evaluation ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5/5)

### Target Market Analysis

**Primary**: **AI Engineering Teams** (startups → enterprises)
- Building LLM-powered products
- Struggling with prompt/config optimization
- Budget-conscious (cost is top 3 concern)
- Need systematic approach to replace trial-and-error

**Secondary**: **Independent AI Developers**
- Prototyping AI applications
- Limited budget for API calls
- Want professional optimization process
- Share results in portfolios

**Tertiary**: **AI Consultants/Agencies**
- Optimize clients' LLM workflows
- Need reproducible methodology
- Charge for expertise, not API costs
- Demonstrate ROI with data

### Problem Validation

**Current Solutions & Gaps:**

| Approach | Cost | Rigor | Interpretability | Coverage |
|----------|------|-------|------------------|----------|
| Trial & Error | High | ❌ Low | ❌ None | ❌ Sparse |
| Grid Search | Very High | ⚠️ Medium | ❌ None | ✅ Complete |
| Bayesian Opt | High | ✅ High | ❌ Black box | ⚠️ Local |
| **TesseractFlow** | **Low** | **✅ High** | **✅ Transparent** | **✅ Systematic** |

**Unique Value Propositions:**

1. **10X Cost Reduction**
   - 8 tests instead of 16 (2⁴ grid search)
   - DeepSeek at $0.00/test vs GPT-4 at $0.10/test
   - **ROI**: Pays for itself in first experiment

2. **Transparency Over Automation**
   - Main effects analysis shows "why"
   - Pareto charts enable informed trade-offs
   - No black-box optimization

3. **Multi-Objective by Default**
   - Quality AND cost AND latency
   - Most tools optimize single metric
   - Real-world constraints respected

4. **Provider Agnostic**
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Test across providers easily
   - Hedge against price changes

### Market Timing

**Why Now:**

1. **LLM Costs Are Dropping** but still significant at scale
2. **Prompt Engineering** is professionalizing (need rigor)
3. **OpenRouter/Cheap Models** make experimentation affordable
4. **Agentic Workflows** increasing complexity (more to optimize)
5. **Enterprise Adoption** requires reproducible processes

### Competitive Landscape

**Direct Competitors:**
