# TesseractFlow Strategy Conversation Summary
**Date:** 2025-10-26
**Context:** Strategic planning session following v0.1.0 release

---

## Executive Summary

This conversation fundamentally reframed TesseractFlow from a "one-shot optimizer" to a **lean LLM optimization platform** for continuous improvement. Key strategic insights:

1. **Economics**: At $0.40/experiment, every AI workflow justifies optimization
2. **Philosophy**: "Get good enough fast, iterate based on learnings" (lean manufacturing)
3. **Learning Focus**: Trade-off curves and insights are more valuable than optimal configs
4. **Business Model**: Open source + consulting-first + BYO API keys = bootstrap without VC
5. **Launch Vehicle**: StoryPunk provides built-in case study and proof of ROI

---

## 1. Primary Request and Intent Evolution

### Initial Request
"Investigate DSPy integration for prompt optimization"

### Evolution Through Conversation

**Phase 1: DSPy Research**
→ Researched DSPy (BootstrapFewShot, MIPROv2)
→ Proposed three integration strategies

**Phase 2: Architecture Reframing** (Critical Pivot)
→ User: "I think prompting strategy, workflow, model and context-strategy (what context do we include, what tools do we make available, what progressive discovery mechanisms are available (MCP, RAG, Claude Skills))"
→ Shifted from "easy config optimization" to "architecture exploration"
→ TesseractFlow = architecture decisions, DSPy = implementation details

**Phase 3: Lean Philosophy**
→ User: "You can almost always pay more...but in lean manufacturing we learn to get good enough as fast as possible and iterate from there as we learn"
→ Reframed as continuous improvement engine vs one-shot optimizer

**Phase 4: Learning Platform**
→ User: "The results are not the point - learning is the point"
→ Trade-off curves become first-class artifacts
→ Created iteration patterns guide

**Phase 5: Knowledge Base**
→ User: "We can also create a knowledge base as we run experiments"
→ Designed self-improving system with vote-up mechanism

**Phase 6: Economics & Business Model**
→ User: "At $0.40 cents...nearly every team AI workflow is worth 'optimizing'"
→ Recognized zero barrier to entry creates universal value prop

**Phase 7: Bootstrap Strategy**
→ User background: TurboGears BDFL, Canonical, Juju/Flux PM
→ No VC needed, consulting-first approach
→ StoryPunk as launch vehicle and case study

### Overarching Intent

Position TesseractFlow as a **lean LLM optimization platform** that enables continuous improvement through cheap ($0.40), fast (10-minute) experimentation rather than expensive ($5), slow (hours) one-shot optimization.

---

## 2. Key Technical Concepts

### Core Framework (Already Implemented)

**Taguchi Design of Experiments (DOE)**
- L8 orthogonal arrays test 4 variables in 8 experiments (vs 16 for full factorial)
- 50% fewer experiments with 90%+ of information
- Standard DOE methodology from manufacturing

**Main Effects Analysis**
- Shows which variables contribute most to quality
- Percentage contributions guide optimization priorities
- Example: "context_strategy: 48%, temperature: 5%"

**Pareto Frontier**
- Multi-objective optimization: Quality + Cost + Latency
- Visualizes trade-offs between competing objectives
- Helps teams choose configurations based on constraints

**LLM-as-Judge Evaluation**
- Rubric-based quality scoring (0-100 scale)
- No labeled data required
- Chain-of-thought reasoning for transparency

**Provider-Agnostic Architecture**
- LiteLLM integration supports 400+ models
- No vendor lock-in
- Test across providers in same experiment

### New Strategic Concepts

#### Exploration vs Exploitation Framing

```
TesseractFlow (Exploration)          DSPy (Exploitation)
├─ Cost: $0.40                       ├─ Cost: $2-5
├─ Speed: 5-10 minutes               ├─ Speed: 1-3 hours
├─ Output: Variable contributions    ├─ Output: Optimized prompts
└─ Goal: Map solution space          └─ Goal: Perfect high-value area
```

**Key Insight**: TesseractFlow finds where to optimize, DSPy does the optimization.

#### The Optimization Hierarchy

**What TesseractFlow Should Test (Architecture-Level)**

1. **Context Strategy** - What information is available?
   - `file_only` vs `full_module` vs `progressive_discovery` (MCP/RAG/Skills)
   - Example finding: "Full module context: +48% contribution to quality"

2. **Workflow Architecture** - How does reasoning flow?
   - `single_pass` vs `agentic_multi_step` vs `human_in_loop`
   - Example finding: "ReAct with tool use: +35% contribution"

3. **Prompting Strategy** - High-level task framing
   - `standard` vs `chain_of_thought` vs `few_shot` vs `verbalized_sampling`
   - Example finding: "CoT: -1.9% contribution (counterintuitive!)"

4. **Model Tier** - Cost/capability tradeoff
   - `budget` vs `mid_tier` vs `premium`
   - Example finding: "Sonnet 4.5 vs Haiku: +6.5% quality, +300% cost"

**What DSPy Should Optimize (Implementation Details)**

1. **Context Strategy Implementation** (After TesseractFlow picks architecture)
   - Exact prompt phrasing: "How to describe what context we're providing?"
   - Summarization instructions: "Focus on X, Y, Z"
   - Metadata formatting: "Include type signatures in format [examples]"

2. **Workflow Step Instructions**
   - Reflection prompts: "How to ask model to critique its own work?"
   - Tool use instructions: "When should model call which tools?"

**The Key Distinction**:
- **TesseractFlow**: "Should we use full_module context?" (architecture choice)
- **DSPy**: "How should we phrase the prompt describing full_module context?" (implementation)

#### Lean Manufacturing Philosophy

**Core Principle**: "Get good enough fast, iterate based on learnings"

**The 80/20 Rule**:
- First $0.40 → 70% of optimal quality (TesseractFlow)
- Next $5.00 → 85% quality (+15%, DSPy)
- Next $50 → 90% quality (+5%, diminishing returns)

**Continuous Improvement Loop**:
```
Sprint 1: Run L8 ($0.40) → Ship baseline (70%)
Sprint 2: Optimize high-impact variable ($0.40) → Ship +8%
Sprint 4: Address user complaints ($0.40) → Ship +2%, 6x faster
Sprint 6: Refine prompts ($0.40) → Ship +5%
Sprint 8: Cost optimization ($0.40) → Ship -3% quality, -35% cost
```

**When to Stop Iterating**:
1. Improvements < 1% per iteration
2. User satisfaction high (NPS > 75)
3. Cost of optimization > value of improvement
4. Main effects all below 10% contribution

#### Learning Focus vs Results Focus

**Traditional Approach** (Results-Focused):
- Run experiment → Get optimal config → Ship it → Done

**TesseractFlow Approach** (Learning-Focused):
- Run experiment → Get trade-off curves + insights → Ship + plan next iteration
- "The results are not the point - learning is the point"

**Trade-Off Curves as First-Class Artifacts**:
```yaml
# Not just "optimal config"
optimal_config:
  model: "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4.5"
  context: "full_module"

# Also "what we learned"
key_learnings:
  - "Context strategy contributes 48% to quality"
  - "Temperature has minimal impact (5%)"
  - "CoT reduces quality (-1.9%) for this task (counterintuitive!)"
  - "Haiku achieves 90% of Sonnet quality at 1/3 cost"

next_iteration_hypothesis:
  - "Test progressive discovery (MCP) vs static full_module"
  - "Expected impact: +15% quality, +20% latency"
```

## 3. Files and Code Sections

### `docs/dspy-integration-research.md`

**Created**: During this conversation
**Purpose**: Position TesseractFlow vs DSPy as complementary tools

**Key Sections**:

#### Executive Summary (Exploration/Exploitation Framing)

```markdown
DSPy (Declarative Self-improving Python) and TesseractFlow solve complementary
optimization problems through a classic **exploration vs exploitation** strategy:

- **TesseractFlow**: **Exploration** - Cheap, fast solution space mapping
  - Cost: $0.40 for 8 experiments (using budget models like DeepSeek)
  - Speed: 5-10 minutes for complete L8 experiment
  - Output: "Which variables matter most? Where should we invest optimization effort?"

- **DSPy**: **Exploitation** - Expensive, thorough optimization of high-value neighborhoods
  - Cost: $2-5 for 50 optimization trials
  - Speed: 1-3 hours for MIPROv2 optimization
  - Output: "Perfect prompts and few-shot examples for the optimal configuration"

**The Strategy**: Use TesseractFlow first ($0.40, 10 minutes) to identify which
variables contribute most to quality. Then use DSPy ($2-5, 1-3 hours) to perfect
the high-impact variables while ignoring low-impact ones.
```

**Why This Matters**: Reframes from "TesseractFlow vs DSPy" to "TesseractFlow → DSPy", making them complementary rather than competitive.

#### The Optimization Hierarchy

```markdown
### What TesseractFlow Should Test (Architecture-Level Decisions)

1. **Context Strategy** - What information is available to the model?
   - Level 1: File-only (just the file being reviewed)
   - Level 2: Full module (file + dependencies + callers)
   - Level 3: Progressive discovery (MCP tools, RAG, Claude Skills)

   Example finding: "Full module context contributes 48% to quality improvement"

2. **Workflow Architecture** - How does reasoning flow?
   - Level 1: Single-pass (one LLM call)
   - Level 2: Multi-step agentic (ReAct, tool use, reflection loops)
   - Level 3: Human-in-the-loop (approval queues, feedback)

   Example finding: "Agentic workflow contributes 35% to quality"

3. **Prompting Strategy** - High-level approach to task framing
   - Level 1: Standard (direct instruction)
   - Level 2: Chain-of-thought (think step-by-step)
   - Level 3: Few-shot (examples provided)
   - Level 4: Verbalized sampling (generate multiple, pick best)

   Example finding: "CoT has -1.9% impact (counterintuitive - task too simple?)"

4. **Model Tier** - Cost/capability tradeoff
   - Level 1: Budget (DeepSeek, Llama-3.1-8B, Haiku)
   - Level 2: Mid-tier (GPT-3.5, Gemini Flash)
   - Level 3: Premium (GPT-4, Claude Sonnet)

   Example finding: "Sonnet 4.5 vs Haiku: +6.5% quality, +300% cost"
```

**Why This Matters**: Clearly delineates what TesseractFlow should test (high-level architecture) vs what it shouldn't (low-level prompt phrasing).

#### Budget Allocation Based on Main Effects

```python
# TesseractFlow main effects output
variable_contributions = {
    "context_strategy": 48%,
    "workflow_architecture": 35%,
    "generation_strategy": 12%,
    "temperature": 5%
}

# DSPy optimization budget: $5.00 total
dspy_budget_allocation = {
    "context": $2.40,      # 48% of $5 budget
    "workflow": $1.75,     # 35% of budget
    "strategy": $0.60,     # 12% of budget
    "temperature": $0.00   # 5% too low to justify optimization cost
}

# Result: Don't waste time optimizing temperature!
```

**Why This Matters**: Shows how TesseractFlow's main effects analysis directly guides where to invest DSPy optimization effort.

#### Concrete Example: MCP/RAG/Skills

```yaml
# TesseractFlow Experiment: Code Review Architecture
variables:
  - name: "context_strategy"
    level_1: "file_only"
    level_2: "progressive_discovery"  # MCP, RAG, Claude Skills

  - name: "workflow_architecture"
    level_1: "single_pass"
    level_2: "agentic_multi_step"     # ReAct with tool use

  - name: "generation_strategy"
    level_1: "standard"
    level_2: "chain_of_thought"

  - name: "model_tier"
    level_1: "budget"                  # DeepSeek
    level_2: "premium"                 # Claude Sonnet

# Results after 8 experiments ($0.40 total):
main_effects:
  context_strategy: 48%      # Progressive discovery wins big
  workflow_architecture: 35% # Agentic helps significantly
  generation_strategy: 12%   # CoT has modest impact
  model_tier: 5%             # Budget model almost as good!

# Key Learning: Architecture matters 10x more than model choice
# Ship with: DeepSeek + progressive_discovery + agentic_multi_step
# Result: 85% quality at 1/3 the cost of premium models

# DSPy then optimizes (optional):
# $2.40 (48%) → "When to trigger MCP tool calls? How to phrase RAG retrieval?"
# $1.75 (35%) → "Reflection prompt phrasing? Tool selection logic?"
# Skip the rest (17%) → Not worth the optimization cost
```

**Why This Matters**: Demonstrates how progressive discovery (MCP/RAG/Skills) is a first-class architectural variable, not just an implementation detail.

### `docs/iteration-patterns.md`

**Created**: During this conversation
**Purpose**: Define TesseractFlow as continuous improvement engine

**Key Content**:

#### Core Philosophy

```markdown
> **"Get good enough results in 10 minutes for $0.40, ship fast,
   iterate based on real usage."**

TesseractFlow is not a one-shot optimizer - it's a **continuous improvement engine**.
Run a $0.40 experiment every sprint, building on learnings from the previous iteration.

**Why This Matters**:
- Traditional optimization: $50-500, weeks of work, one-shot attempt
- TesseractFlow: $0.40, 10 minutes, continuous refinement
- Ship baseline quality in Sprint 1, improve 5-10% every sprint
- Compound improvements over 6 months → 30-50% total gains
```

**Why This Matters**: Completely reframes value proposition from "get optimal config" to "continuous learning and improvement".

#### The Five-Iteration Journey

```markdown
### Iteration 1: Architecture Foundation ($0.40, Sprint 1)

**Goal**: Establish baseline, identify high-impact variables

**Variables Tested**:
- model_tier: budget vs premium
- context_strategy: file_only vs full_module
- workflow_architecture: single_pass vs agentic
- prompting_strategy: standard vs chain_of_thought

**Results**:
- context_strategy: 52% contribution (biggest lever!)
- workflow_architecture: 28% contribution
- model_tier: 15% contribution
- prompting_strategy: 5% contribution

**Key Learning**: "Context matters most, temperature doesn't"

**Action**: Ship with full_module + budget model
**Quality**: 70% (baseline)
**Cost**: $0.50/run

---

### Iteration 2: Optimize High-Impact Variable ($0.40, Sprint 2)

**Goal**: Deep dive on context strategy (52% contribution)

**Variables Tested**:
- context_scope: file vs file+deps vs file+deps+callers vs full_module
- context_format: raw vs summarized vs structured
- context_summarization: none vs ai_summary vs template
- context_metadata: minimal vs types vs full_docstrings

**Results**:
- context_scope: 45% contribution (transitive deps critical!)
- context_metadata: 38% contribution (type annotations help!)
- context_format: 12% contribution
- context_summarization: 5% contribution

**Key Learning**: "Include transitive dependencies + type annotations"

**Action**: Update context strategy
**Quality**: 78% (+8% improvement)
**Cost**: $0.55/run (+10% cost, worth it)

---

### Iteration 3: Address User Pain Points ($0.40, Sprint 4)

**Goal**: Fix biggest complaint (slow responses)

**Context**: Users complain reviews take 30 seconds

**Variables Tested**:
- context_loading: static_full vs mcp_on_demand
- tool_availability: none vs search vs search+docs
- caching_strategy: none vs embeddings vs context_cache
- streaming_output: false vs true

**Results**:
- mcp_on_demand: 42% contribution (quality AND speed!)
- caching: 35% contribution (6x speedup!)
- streaming: 18% contribution (UX improvement)
- tool_availability: 5% contribution

**Key Learning**: "MCP improves both quality AND speed (loads only what's needed)"

**Action**: Switch to MCP + enable caching
**Quality**: 80% (+2% improvement)
**Latency**: 5 seconds (6x improvement!)
**Cost**: $0.45/run (-18%, MCP loads less context)

---

### Iteration 4: Prompt Refinement ($0.40, Sprint 6)

**Goal**: Optimize prompts within stable architecture

**Context**: Architecture is solid, now refine implementation

**Variables Tested**:
- task_framing: imperative vs collaborative vs expert_role
- output_format: markdown vs json vs structured_json
- tool_usage_prompts: implicit vs explicit vs examples
- evaluation_criteria: simple vs detailed vs rubric

**Results**:
- tool_usage_prompts: 42% contribution (explicit instructions critical!)
- task_framing: 28% contribution (expert role works best)
- evaluation_criteria: 20% contribution (detailed rubric helps)
- output_format: 10% contribution

**Key Learning**: "Explicit tool instructions matter most"

**Action**: Rewrite prompts with explicit tool instructions
**Quality**: 85% (+5% improvement)
**Cost**: $0.45/run (no change)

---

### Iteration 5: Cost Optimization ($0.40, Sprint 8)

**Goal**: Reduce costs while maintaining quality

**Context**: Hitting budget limits, need to cut costs

**Variables Tested**:
- model_mixing: single vs summarize_cheap+analyze_expensive
- embeddings: none vs ada_002 vs voyage_2
- prompt_compression: none vs lightweight vs aggressive
- caching_ttl: 1h vs 24h vs 7d

**Results**:
- model_mixing: 48% contribution (use DeepSeek for summaries!)
- caching_ttl: 32% contribution (7d cache safe)
- embeddings: 15% contribution (voyage_2 marginally better)
- prompt_compression: 5% contribution

**Key Learning**: "Use cheap models for summarization, expensive for analysis"

**Action**: Mix DeepSeek (summaries) + Haiku (analysis)
**Quality**: 82% (-3% acceptable tradeoff)
**Cost**: $0.29/run (-35% cost reduction!)

---

**Total Progress After 5 Iterations**:
- Starting point: 70% quality, $0.50/run, 30s latency
- After 5 sprints: 82% quality, $0.29/run, 5s latency
- Investment: 5 × $0.40 = $2.00
- ROI: 17% quality improvement, 42% cost reduction, 6x speed improvement
```

**Why This Matters**: Provides concrete roadmap showing how to compound improvements over time, demonstrating the continuous improvement philosophy.

#### Six Core Iteration Patterns

```markdown
### Pattern 1: Start Broad, Then Narrow

Iteration 1: Test 4 diverse variables (architecture-level)
Iteration 2: Deep dive on highest-impact variable (52% contribution)
Iteration 3: Optimize second-highest (28% contribution)
Iteration 4+: Diminishing returns, shift to cost/speed

**When to Use**: Every project (always start broad)

---

### Pattern 2: Follow the Main Effects

Let data guide next iteration:
- Variable with 50%+ contribution → Deep dive immediately
- Variable with 30-50% → Explore in Iteration 2-3
- Variable with 10-30% → Optimize later if needed
- Variable with <10% → Ignore (not worth optimization cost)

**When to Use**: Every iteration (let data drive decisions)

---

### Pattern 3: User Feedback First

Don't optimize quality in a vacuum:
- Run experiment → Ship → Collect user feedback
- Next iteration addresses biggest user complaint
- Example: Users complain about speed → Test latency optimizations

**When to Use**: After Iteration 1 (once users are using it)

---

### Pattern 4: Pareto Frontier Walk

Test quality-cost tradeoffs:
- Start: Maximize quality (budget not constraint)
- Iteration 3-4: Find sweet spot (80% quality at 1/3 cost)
- Iteration 5+: Cost reduction without sacrificing quality

**When to Use**: When hitting budget constraints

---

### Pattern 5: Progressive Refinement

Architecture → Implementation → Fine-tuning:
- Iteration 1-2: Architecture decisions (context, workflow, model tier)
- Iteration 3-4: Implementation details (prompts, tools, formatting)
- Iteration 5+: Fine-tuning (caching, compression, mixing)

**When to Use**: Complex workflows requiring multiple refinement stages

---

### Pattern 6: A/B Test in Production

Validate with real users:
- Run experiment → Identify optimal config
- A/B test: Current (70%) vs Optimal (80%)
- If users prefer optimal → Ship it
- If no difference → Stay with cheaper current config

**When to Use**: High-stakes production deployments
```

**Why This Matters**: Provides reusable patterns teams can apply to any workflow, making TesseractFlow accessible to non-experts.

#### When to Stop Iterating

```markdown
### Signal 1: Diminishing Returns
Improvements drop below 1% per iteration
- Iteration 4: +5% improvement → Keep going
- Iteration 5: +2% improvement → Maybe one more
- Iteration 6: +0.5% improvement → Stop

### Signal 2: User Satisfaction High
NPS score > 75, few complaints
- Focus on new features, not optimization

### Signal 3: Cost of Optimization > Value
$0.40 experiment yields $4 in savings → Worth it (10x ROI)
$0.40 experiment yields $0.20 in savings → Not worth it (0.5x ROI)

### Signal 4: Main Effects All Below 10%
All variables contribute <10% → Hitting optimization ceiling
- Further improvements require fundamentally different approach
```

**Why This Matters**: Prevents endless optimization, helps teams know when to move on.

## 4. Strategic Insights

### The $0.40 Economics

**Why This Changes Everything**:

Traditional LLM optimization:
- Cost: $500-5000 (consultant time + tools)
- Time: Weeks to months
- Barrier: Need budget approval, executive buy-in
- Result: Only high-value projects get optimized

TesseractFlow optimization:
- Cost: $0.40 per experiment
- Time: 10 minutes
- Barrier: None (engineer can run on own initiative)
- Result: **Every AI workflow justifies optimization**

**The Math**:

```
Scenario: Code review workflow, 100 reviews/month

Current cost: $50/month (Sonnet 4.5, single-pass, full context)

TesseractFlow experiment: $0.40

Findings:
- DeepSeek achieves 90% of Sonnet quality at 1/10 cost
- Progressive discovery (MCP) reduces context by 60%
- Multi-step workflow improves quality +8%

New config: DeepSeek + MCP + multi-step
New cost: $12/month
Savings: $38/month

ROI: $38 * 12 months / $0.40 = 1,140x return
```

**Implications**:

1. **Universal Value Prop**: No workflow too small to optimize
2. **No Sales Cycle**: Engineer can expense $0.40 on credit card
3. **Viral Growth**: Teams share configs, everyone tries it
4. **Network Effects**: More experiments → Better knowledge base

### Business Model: Open Source + Consulting-First

**The Strategy**:

```
Phase 1 (Months 1-3): Consulting-First
├─ Open source v0.1 released
├─ StoryPunk case study published
├─ Inbound consulting leads (10-20/month)
├─ Close 2-3 clients ($20k-45k total)
└─ Revenue funds product development

Phase 2 (Months 4-6): Developer Tier Launch
├─ Ship v0.2 with knowledge base
├─ Developer tier: $5/month (BYO API keys, hosted KB)
├─ Target: 20-30 paying developers
├─ MRR: $100-150
└─ Consulting: 5-6 clients ($40k-90k total)

Phase 3 (Months 7-12): Team Tier Launch
├─ Ship v0.3 with collaboration features
├─ Team tier: $20/seat (shared KBs, admin dashboard)
├─ Target: 5-10 teams (3-5 seats each)
├─ MRR: $400-800
└─ Consulting: 8-12 clients ($80k-180k total)

Phase 4 (Year 2): Organization Tier
├─ Organization tier: $200/month (enterprise features)
├─ Target: 3-5 orgs
├─ MRR: $600-1000 + $500-800 team tier
├─ Total MRR: $1100-1800
└─ Consulting: $150k-300k/year
```

**Why BYO API Keys Matter**:

Traditional SaaS: Host pays for LLM API calls
- Example: 100 users × $5/user/month in API costs = $500/month hosting cost
- Must charge $10-15/user to break even
- Barrier to free tier (can't afford API costs)

TesseractFlow: Users bring own API keys
- Hosting cost: $0 (users pay OpenAI/Anthropic directly)
- Can offer generous free tier

**The Case Study** (StoryPunk Optimization):

```markdown
# How We Reduced AI Costs by 76% While Improving Quality

**The Problem**:
Publishing AI-assisted books cost $500 in LLM API calls per book. At 2 books/month,
that's $12,000/year in AI costs for a small press.

**The Solution**:
We built TesseractFlow to systematically optimize our LLM workflows using Taguchi
Design of Experiments.

**The Process**:

Experiment 1: Scene Generation ($0.40, 10 minutes)
- Tested: Model tier, context strategy, prompting, temperature
- Found: DeepSeek achieves 85% of Claude quality at 1/10 cost
- Saved: $150/book

Experiment 2: Character Development ($0.40, 10 minutes)
- Tested: Few-shot examples, context format, generation strategy
- Found: 3 example characters critical (+42% consistency)
- Saved: $80/book

Experiment 3: Dialogue Enhancement ($0.40, 10 minutes)
- Tested: Streaming, MCP tools, workflow architecture
- Found: MCP character sheets improve dialogue consistency +28%
- Saved: $50/book

**Total Investment**: 3 × $0.40 = $1.20
**Total Savings**: $500 → $120/book = $380/book
**Annual Savings**: $380 × 24 books = $9,120/year
**ROI**: 7,600x

**The Learnings**:
- Budget models (DeepSeek, Haiku) match premium quality for structured tasks
- Few-shot examples matter more than model choice for consistency
- Progressive discovery (MCP) improves quality AND reduces cost
- Most tasks don't need premium models

**What's Next**:
We're open-sourcing TesseractFlow and offering consulting to help other teams
optimize their LLM workflows. At $0.40/experiment, every AI workflow is worth
optimizing.
