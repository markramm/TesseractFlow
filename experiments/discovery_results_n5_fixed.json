This means I need to condense the story's key elements (plot, characters, themes) into a brief summary without extensive background information.\n\n2. **Assess the Need for Context**: Since no specific story is provided, I must decide whether to proceed with a general approach or request more context. Summarizing without any story is impossible, so I need at least the title or basic details of the story.\n\n3. **Autonomous Decision**: I will assume the requester expects a general method for summarizing any complex story with minimal context. If a specific story were provided, I could tailor the summary accordingly.\n\n4. **General Approach for Summarizing**:\n   - Identify the core conflict or central theme.\n   - Highlight key characters and their roles.\n   - Outline the main plot points (beginning, middle, end).\n   - Omit minor details or subplots unless critical.\n   - Keep the summary concise (1-3 sentences for minimal context).\n\n5. **Example Summary (if a story were provided)**:\n   - For *\"Inception\"*: \"A thief who steals secrets by entering dreams is tasked with planting an idea in a target's subconscious. As he assembles a team, the lines between reality and dreams blur, leading to a climactic heist within layered dreams and an ambiguous ending.\"\n\n6. **Final Answer**: Since no specific story is given, here's a template for summarizing any complex story with minimal context:  \n   *\"In [Story Title], [protagonist] must [central goal/conflict], leading to [key events]. The story explores [theme] and concludes with [ending tone/outcome].\"*  \n\nIf you provide the story title or details, I can give a tailored summary. Otherwise, this template can be applied universally.  \n\n**Would you like to share the story you'd like summarized?**",

      "workflow_output": "Discovered Content:\nTo summarize a complex story with minimal context, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Identify the Core Elements\nExtract the most critical components of the story, such as:\n- **Main characters or entities** (who is involved?)\n- **Central conflict or goal** (what is the primary struggle or objective?)\n- **Key events** (what major actions or turning points occur?)\n- **Resolution or outcome** (how does the story conclude or evolve?)\n\n### Step 2: Strip Away Non-Essential Details\nOmit subplots, secondary characters, and intricate world-building unless they directly impact the core narrative. Focus on the \"big picture.\"\n\n### Step 3: Use Broad Strokes\nDescribe events or themes in general terms without delving into specifics. For example:\n- Instead of detailing a character's backstory, state their role (e.g., \"a exiled prince seeking revenge\").\n- Replace a multi-step quest with a single phrase (e.g., \"a journey to reclaim a stolen artifact\").\n\n### Step 4: Maintain Logical Flow\nEnsure the summary retains cause-and-effect coherence, even if simplified. For example:\n- \"X betrayed Y, leading to Z\" instead of explaining the betrayal's nuances.\n\n### Step 5: Adapt Based on Available Context\nIf the story is provided upfront, use only the most salient points. If context is missing, infer the simplest plausible thread or state what’s unclear.\n\n---\n\n### Example Summary (Without Specific Context):\n\"A fallen hero, haunted by past failures, embarks on a perilous journey to defeat a rising darkness. Betrayed by an ally, they sacrifice themselves to save their world, leaving their legacy to inspire others.\"\n\n### Key Principles:\n1. **Minimalism**: Omit details that aren’t pivotal.\n2. **Autonomy**: If critical gaps exist (e.g., missing protagonist or conflict), note: \"Insufficient context to summarize key elements.\"\n3. **Universality**: Make the summary understandable even to someone unfamiliar with the story.\n\nThis approach balances clarity and brevity while preserving the narrative essence.",
