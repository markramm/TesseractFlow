This creates artificial limitations. [line 5] Suggested fix: Use `Union[int, float]` or a numeric protocol: `from typing import Union` and change signature to `def add(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]:`\n- (medium) No validation that inputs are actually numeric types.

[line 5] Suggested fix: Add runtime validation: `if not isinstance(a, (int, float)) or not isinstance(b, (int, float)): raise TypeError('Arguments must be numeric')`\n- (low) Functions lack docstrings explaining parameters, return values, and behavior. Module docstring is generic. [line 5] Suggested fix: Add comprehensive docstrings:\n```python\ndef add(a: Union[int, float], b: Union[int, float]) -> Union[int, float]:\n    \"\"\"Add two numbers.\n    \n    Args:\n        a: First number\n        b: Second number\n    \n    Returns:\n        Sum of a and b\n    \n    Raises:\n        TypeError: If inputs are not numeric\n    \"\"\"\n```\n- (low) Functions don't handle potential edge cases like overflow (in some contexts) or provide meaningful error messages.

      "workflow_output": "The code is functionally correct and follows basic Python conventions with type hints. However, it lacks robustness, documentation, and error handling that would be expected in production code. The module is minimal but has several areas for improvement regarding validation, edge cases, and maintainability.\nIssues:\n- (medium) Functions accept any type despite int type hints. No validation ensures inputs are actually integers. This could lead to unexpected behavior with floats, strings, or None values. Suggested fix: Add runtime validation or use a decorator to enforce type checking. Consider using libraries like 'typeguard' or implement explicit isinstance() checks if strict type enforcement is needed.\n- (medium) Functions lack docstrings explaining parameters, return values, and potential exceptions. Module docstring is generic and doesn't describe the module's purpose or usage. Suggested fix: Add comprehensive docstrings following Google or NumPy style. Example: 'Adds two integers and returns their sum. Args: a (int): First number. b (int): Second number. Returns: int: Sum of a and b.'\n- (low) Functions don't handle potential errors like TypeError if non-numeric types are passed, or OverflowError for very large numbers. Suggested fix: Add try-except blocks or input validation. Decide whether to raise TypeError for invalid inputs or attempt type coercion based on requirements.\n- (medium) No test file provided.
