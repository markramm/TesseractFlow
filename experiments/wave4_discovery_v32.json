A young scientist, Dr. Elara Voss, discovers a hidden alien artifact that could revolutionize energy production. However, Earth’s government seeks to control the technology, while the colonies view it as a chance for independence. Caught in the middle, Elara must navigate political intrigue, betrayal, and her own moral dilemmas to decide the artifact’s fate. Her choices ultimately shape the balance of power in the galaxy. \n\n**Key Points:**  \n- Interplanetary conflict over resources and autonomy.  \n- Discovery of a transformative alien artifact.  \n- Scientist’s struggle between Earth and colonial interests.  \n- Moral and political dilemmas drive the narrative.  \n- Outcome influences galactic power dynamics.  \n\nThis summary captures the essence of the story without delving into unnecessary details.",

Kael, guided by Aether, embarks on a journey to rally the scattered remnants of the fleet, facing betrayal, loss, and the growing influence of the Void. Along the way, he learns that his own lineage is tied to the creation of the fleet, and he must confront the truth about his family’s sacrifice.

As layers of reality blur, the mission succeeds—but whether he escapes limbo is left ambiguous.*  \n\nIf the provided story is more obscure or lacks context, I’ll:  \n- Flag where gaps hinder coherence (e.g., *\"Unable to resolve the protagonist’s motive without backstory\"*).  \n- Hypothesize sparingly (e.g., *\"The ritual’s purpose seems tied to sacrifice, but the stakes are unclear\"*).  \n\nProvide the story (or its minimal context), and I’ll generate a concise summary under these constraints.",

To summarize a complex story with minimal context, I'll proceed as follows:  \n\n1. **Identify Core Elements**: Extract key characters, central conflict, and major plot turns.  \n2. **Condense Causality**: Focus on cause-and-effect relationships driving the narrative.  \n3. **Prune Subplots**: Omit tangential details unless they critically impact the resolution.  \n4. **Preserve Ambiguity**: Avoid injecting assumptions beyond the provided context.  \n\n**Example Summary** (if given a story like *Inception*):  \n*A thief infiltrates minds through shared dreams to implant an idea. As layers of reality blur, his unresolved guilt over his wife’s death jeopardizes the mission. The team succeeds, but the ending leaves his reality ambiguous.*  \n\nIf the story’s complexity demands clarification (e.g., unclear motives, unexplained twists), I’ll request specific missing context. Otherwise, I’ll distill it as-is.  \n\nReady for your story! Provide the details, and I’ll compress it rigorously.",
