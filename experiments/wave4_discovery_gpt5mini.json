To summarize a complex story with minimal context, I'll:  \n\n1. **Identify Core Elements**: Extract key characters, central conflict, and major plot turns.  \n2. **Condense Causality**: Focus on cause-and-effect relationships driving the narrative.  \n3. **Prune Details**: Omit subplots or world-building unless critical to the main arc.  \n4. **Preserve Ambiguity**: If context is intentionally sparse (e.g., surreal or experimental stories), reflect that in the summary.  \n\n**Example**:  \n*Original*: A scientist discovers time travel, alters a childhood event to avoid trauma, and returns to a dystopian present where their actions erased a key invention. They must reconcile with their past self to restore the timeline.  \n*Summary*: A time-traveling scientist’s attempt to fix their past backfires, forcing a collaboration with their younger self to undo catastrophic changes.  \n\nIf the story’s complexity hinges on unclear context (e.g., unreliable narration, abstract themes), I’ll note gaps:  \n*\"Summary unclear—missing context on whether the protagonist’s visions are real or delusional.\"*  \n\nLet me know the story, and I’ll distill it accordingly!",

He succeeds in animating a creature using stolen body parts and unconventional science. However, upon seeing the grotesque appearance of his creation, Victor is horrified and abandons it. The creature, lonely and rejected, seeks acceptance but is met with fear and violence from society. It learns to speak and reason, eventually confronting Victor, demanding that he create a companion for it. When Victor refuses, the creature vows revenge, leading to a series of tragic events, including the deaths of Victor’s loved ones. The story explores themes of ambition, responsibility, isolation, and the consequences of playing god. Victor pursues the creature to the Arctic, where he dies, and the creature, remorseful, disappears into the icy wilderness.\n\nThis is a summary of **Mary Shelley’s *Frankenstein***.",

To summarize a complex story with minimal context, I'll:  \n\n1. **Identify Core Elements**: Extract key characters, central conflict, and major plot turns.  \n2. **Condense Causality**: Focus on cause-and-effect relationships driving the narrative.  \n3. **Prune Details**: Omit subplots or world-building unless critical to the main arc.  \n4. **Preserve Ambiguity**: If context is intentionally sparse (e.g., surreal or experimental stories), reflect that in the summary.  \n\n**Example**:  \n*Original*: A scientist discovers time travel, alters a childhood event to avoid trauma, and returns to a dystopian present where their actions erased a key invention. They must reconcile with their past self to restore the timeline.  \n*Summary*: A time-traveling scientist’s attempt to fix their past backfires, forcing a collaboration with their younger self to undo catastrophic changes.  \n\nIf the story’s complexity hinges on unclear context (e.g., unreliable narration, abstract themes), I’ll note gaps:  \n*\"Summary unclear—missing context on whether the protagonist’s visions are real or delusional.\"*  \n\nLet me know the story, and I’ll distill it accordingly!",
