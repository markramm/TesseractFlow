## Philosophy: Test What You Can't Google

**Avoid:**
- "DeepSeek vs Claude on generic benchmarks" ← Already documented
- "Temperature effects on creativity" ← Well-understood
- "Context window utilization" ← Model spec sheet

**Focus On:**
- **Production edge cases** your workflows actually encounter
- **Trade-offs** specific to creative writing (consistency vs originality)
- **Interaction effects** between variables (does temperature matter more with full context?)
- **Progressive refinement** patterns (when to iterate vs ship)
- **Quality-cost inflection points** (where does spending more stop helping?)

## Experiment 1: Scene Generation - The Consistency vs Creativity Paradox

### The Real-World Problem

**Your Challenge:** Fiction needs both consistency (characters stay in voice, plot threads track) AND creativity (fresh descriptions, unexpected emotional beats).

**Question No One Has Answered:**
> "For DeepSeek R1, does the optimal temperature for consistency (character voice, continuity) differ from the optimal temperature for creativity (prose variety, emotional surprise)? And does verbalized sampling (generating multiple reasoning paths) outperform temperature variation for creativity? Does this interact with context size?"

### Why This Matters

- If consistency temperature ≠ creativity temperature → Use two-model approach (consistent base + creative polish)
- If verbalized sampling beats temperature → New technique for boosting creativity
- If context size moderates this → Adjust based on how much lorebook you provide
- **Verbalized sampling has minimal real-world testing** - this is novel research

### Experiment Design

**Variables (L8):**
1. `generation_strategy`: standard vs verbalized_sampling (3 reasoning paths → best)
2. `base_temperature`: 0.3 vs 0.7
3. `context_depth`: minimal (scene+chars) vs full (scene+chars+style+prev_scenes)
4. `workflow`: single_pass vs two_pass (draft → polish)

**Test Scenes:** 5 scenes with different challenges
- `s01_opening`: Character introduction (voice establishment)
- `s15_midpoint`: Emotional revelation (surprise + consistency)
- `s22_intimate`: Erotic scene (heat + character truth)
- `s30_conflict`: Argument dialogue (distinct voices + escalation)
- `s45_resolution`: Callback to earlier beats (continuity)

**Dual Rubrics:**

*Consistency Rubric (0-100):*
- Character voice consistency (40 pts)
- Plot continuity (30 pts)
- Tone/style adherence (30 pts)

*Creativity Rubric (0-100):*
- Prose originality (40 pts)
- Emotional surprise (30 pts)
- Descriptive freshness (30 pts)

**Analysis:**
- Which config optimizes consistency?
- Which config optimizes creativity?
- Are they the same? (If not, two-pass workflow wins)
- Does context depth change the answer?

**Hypothesis:**
- Verbalized sampling increases creativity (+20%) without hurting consistency
- Higher temperature improves creativity but hurts consistency
- Full context allows higher temperature without sacrificing consistency
- Verbalized sampling + low temperature beats high temperature alone

**Actionable Outcomes:**
- ✅ "Verbalized sampling at 0.5 temp: +22% creativity, no consistency penalty"
- ✅ "Temperature alone: 0.7 gives +12% creativity, -8% consistency (worse trade-off)"
- ✅ "Full context enables verbalized sampling to work better (+15% improvement)"
- ✅ "Two-pass workflow: standard 0.3 → verbalized_sampling 0.5 (optimal)"

## Experiment 2: Character Development - Progressive Refinement Efficiency

### The Real-World Problem

**Your Challenge:** Character arcs evolve over 50+ scenes. Early character descriptions get outdated as arcs progress.

**Question No One Has Answered:**
> "When revising a character sheet mid-story, is it more effective to: (A) regenerate from scratch with updated context, (B) iteratively refine existing description, or (C) merge old + new insights? And does the answer change based on how much the character has changed?"

### Why This Matters

- You're already 20 scenes in, character has evolved
- Do you trash existing character sheet and regenerate? (Costs continuity)
- Or refine incrementally? (Costs freshness)
- Or merge old stable traits + new developments? (Best of both?)

### Experiment Design

**Variables (L8):**
1. `revision_strategy`: regenerate vs refine vs merge
2. `change_magnitude`: minor (10% arc progress) vs major (50% arc progress)
3. `context_scope`: current_scene_only vs full_arc_history
4. `output_format`: freeform vs structured_json (name, traits, arc, voice)

**Test Cases:** 3 characters at different arc points
- `elena_act1`: Early arc (establishing baseline)
- `elena_act2`: Midpoint shift (moderate change)
- `marcus_act3`: Major transformation (near-complete arc)

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Continuity preservation** (70 pts): Maintains established traits that shouldn't change
- **Arc progression accuracy** (30 pts): Reflects character growth to date
- **Utility for writers** (subjective): Can you actually use this?

**Analysis:**
- Does regenerate vs refine matter?
- Does magnitude of change affect optimal strategy?
- Is structured output more useful than freeform?

**Hypothesis:**
- Merge wins for minor changes (preserves continuity + adds growth)
- Regenerate wins for major changes (avoids contradictions)
- Structured format enables better merging

**Actionable Outcomes:**
- ✅ "For <30% arc progress: Use refine strategy"
- ✅ "For >50% arc progress: Regenerate with full context"
- ✅ "Structured JSON format enables 40% faster merges"

## Experiment 3: Dialogue Enhancement - Voice Distinctiveness vs Natural Flow

### The Real-World Problem

**Your Challenge:** Dialogue needs distinct character voices BUT also natural conversational flow.

**Question No One Has Answered:**
> "Does emphasizing character voice differentiation (via explicit prompting + examples) trade off against conversational naturalism? Can DeepSeek maintain both, or do you need to choose?"

### Why This Matters

- Weak AI dialogue: Everyone sounds the same (natural but boring)
- Overcooked AI dialogue: Caricatures ("As a linguistics professor, I must say..." every line)
- Sweet spot: Distinct but believable

### Experiment Design

**Variables (L8):**
1. `voice_emphasis`: subtle vs explicit (prompt strength)
2. `voice_examples`: 0 vs 3 (few-shot dialogue samples per character)
3. `conversation_context`: isolated_exchange vs full_scene_flow
4. `speaker_attribution`: included vs omitted (forces voice to carry weight)

**Test Dialogues:** 3 conversation types
- `first_meeting`: Establishing voices (2 characters, no history)
- `argument`: High emotion (2 characters, conflict)
- `group_scene`: Multiple voices (4 characters, casual)

**Dual Rubrics:**

*Voice Distinctiveness (0-100):*
- Can you identify speaker without attribution? (50 pts)
- Voice reflects character background/personality? (30 pts)
- Distinct syntax, word choice, rhythm? (20 pts)

*Conversational Naturalism (0-100):*
- Realistic pacing, interruptions, pauses? (40 pts)
- Natural topic shifts, callbacks? (30 pts)
- Avoids on-the-nose exposition? (30 pts)

**Analysis:**
- Do voice distinctiveness and naturalism trade off?
- Do few-shot examples help or hurt?
- Does full scene context improve both?

**Hypothesis:**
- Explicit voice emphasis improves distinctiveness but hurts naturalism
- Few-shot examples improve both (if well-chosen)
- Full scene context enables better conversational flow

**Actionable Outcomes:**
- ✅ "3 dialogue examples per character: +25% distinctiveness, +15% naturalism"
- ✅ "Explicit voice prompting: +30% distinct, -10% natural (not worth it)"
- ✅ "Full scene context essential for multi-character conversations"

## Experiment 4: Scene Review - The Calibration Problem

### The Real-World Problem

**Your Challenge:** AI reviewers tend to be either too harsh (discouraging) or too lenient (useless).

**Question No One Has Answered:**
> "How do you calibrate DeepSeek to give useful scene reviews that: (1) match human judgment distribution, (2) provide actionable feedback, and (3) maintain consistent standards across scenes?"

### Why This Matters

- Uncalibrated: All scenes score 85-95 (no signal)
- Overcalibrated: All scenes score 40-60 (demoralizing)
- Useful: Scores match actual quality + feedback is specific

### Experiment Design

**Variables (L8):**
1. `calibration_method`: none vs example_scenes vs rubric_anchors vs score_distribution
2. `feedback_style`: scores_only vs scores_plus_rationale vs scores_plus_suggestions
3. `comparison_mode`: absolute vs relative (to previous scenes)
4. `judge_temperature`: 0.1 (strict) vs 0.3 (lenient)

**Test Scenes:** 8 scenes with known quality spread
- 2 excellent scenes (human-rated 90+)
- 3 good scenes (human-rated 75-85)
- 2 mediocre scenes (human-rated 60-70)
- 1 poor scene (human-rated <50)

**Validation Metrics:**
- **Correlation with human ratings** (r-value)
- **Score distribution spread** (std dev)
- **Feedback actionability** (can you improve based on it?)

**Analysis:**
- Which calibration method yields highest correlation?
- Does feedback style affect score accuracy?
- Does relative vs absolute scoring change distribution?

**Hypothesis:**
- Rubric anchors (example scores) improve calibration
- Temperature 0.1 yields more consistent scores
- Relative comparison causes grade inflation

**Actionable Outcomes:**
- ✅ "Use 3 anchor examples (low/mid/high) for r=0.87 correlation"
- ✅ "Temperature 0.1 for scoring, 0.3 for feedback generation"
- ✅ "Absolute scoring prevents drift over time"

## Experiment 5: Multi-Pass Revision - Diminishing Returns Analysis

### The Real-World Problem

**Your Challenge:** You can always make a scene better with another revision pass, but at what cost?

**Question No One Has Answered:**
> "For DeepSeek R1, what's the marginal quality improvement curve for successive revision passes? When do you hit the point of diminishing returns?"

### Why This Matters

- Pass 1 → Pass 2: Maybe +15% quality
- Pass 2 → Pass 3: Maybe +5% quality
- Pass 3 → Pass 4: Maybe +1% quality, +risk of over-polishing
- Where's the inflection point?

### Experiment Design

**Variables (L8):**
1. `revision_passes`: 1 vs 2 vs 3 vs 4
2. `focus_per_pass`: same (general) vs progressive (prose→dialogue→emotion→continuity)
3. `model_consistency`: same_model vs alternating (DeepSeek→Haiku→DeepSeek)
4. `feedback_loop`: none vs quality_score_guided (stop if score plateaus)

**Test Scenes:** 4 scenes with different baseline quality
- `scene_a`: Already strong (baseline 80)
- `scene_b`: Needs work (baseline 65)
- `scene_c`: Multiple issues (baseline 55)
- `scene_d`: First draft rough (baseline 45)

**Metrics Tracked Per Pass:**
- Quality score (0-100)
- Cost ($)
- Time (seconds)
- Marginal improvement (Δ from previous pass)

**Analysis:**
- Plot quality vs passes (where does curve flatten?)
- Does baseline quality affect optimal pass count?
- Is progressive focus better than general revision each time?
- Can you predict optimal stopping point from early scores?

**Hypothesis:**
- Pass 1→2: +10-20% improvement
- Pass 2→3: +3-8% improvement
- Pass 3→4: <2% improvement (not worth it)
- Progressive focus (different targets each pass) prevents over-polishing

**Actionable Outcomes:**
- ✅ "Stop after 2 passes for >75 baseline scenes (ROI drops 80%)"
- ✅ "Use 3 passes for <60 baseline scenes"
- ✅ "Progressive focus: +12% quality vs uniform revision"
- ✅ "If pass improvement <5%, stop (quality plateau)"

## Experiment 6: Context Strategy - The Progressive Discovery Test

### The Real-World Problem

**Your Challenge:** More context improves consistency but increases cost and latency. Progressive discovery (start minimal, fetch on-demand) could optimize both.

**Question No One Has Answered:**
> "For fiction scene generation, is progressive discovery (MCP-style: minimal initial context + fetch character/world details on-demand) better than upfront full context? And does DeepSeek R1's reasoning capability make it better at using progressive discovery than simpler models?"

### Why This Matters

- Full context upfront: $0.004/scene, 60s, high consistency
- Progressive discovery: $0.00?/scene, ??s, ??% consistency
- If progressive beats full: Major cost savings + faster generation

### Experiment Design

**Variables (L8):**
1. `context_strategy`: full_upfront vs progressive_discovery
2. `discovery_trigger`: model_decides vs explicit_prompts ("ask for character details when needed")
3. `discovery_scope`: character_only vs character_plus_world
4. `context_format`: prose vs structured_json (easier for model to parse?)

**Implementation Note:**
- Simulate MCP by: Initial prompt with minimal context + "You can request additional context by asking: CHARACTER_DETAILS[name], WORLD_INFO[topic], PREVIOUS_SCENE[num]"
- Track: How many requests? Which details? Does it help?

**Test Scenes:** 4 scenes with varying context needs
- `simple_scene`: 2 characters, simple setting (low context needs)
- `callback_scene`: References events from 5 scenes ago (high continuity needs)
- `worldbuilding_scene`: Complex magic system explanation (high lore needs)
- `ensemble_scene`: 5 characters with complex relationships (high character needs)

**Metrics:**
- Quality score (0-100)
- Cost ($ - does progressive actually cost less?)
- Latency (seconds)
- Context requests made (count + relevance)

**Analysis:**
- Does progressive discovery reduce cost without sacrificing quality?
- For which scene types does progressive win?
- Does DeepSeek actually request relevant context?
- Is structured JSON better than prose for context retrieval?

**Hypothesis:**
- Progressive reduces cost by 30-50% for simple scenes
- Progressive matches full context for simple scenes but fails on complex
- Structured JSON improves discovery accuracy
- Explicit prompts ("ask if you need X") work better than model-decides

**Actionable Outcomes:**
- ✅ "Use progressive for <3 character scenes: -40% cost, -5% quality"
- ✅ "Use full context for >3 characters or callback-heavy scenes"
- ✅ "Structured JSON format enables 2x more accurate requests"
- ✅ "Explicit discovery prompts outperform implicit by 35%"

## Experiment 7: Quality Metric Reliability - The Judge Calibration Study

### The Real-World Problem

**Your Challenge:** You're using DeepSeek to evaluate scenes generated by DeepSeek. Can a model reliably judge its own work? Does it have blind spots?

**Question No One Has Answered:**
> "When DeepSeek R1 evaluates DeepSeek R1-generated scenes, does it: (1) over-rate its own output (bias), (2) miss systematic errors (blind spots), or (3) provide reliable quality estimates? And does a different evaluator model (Haiku, GPT-4) catch different issues?"

### Why This Matters

- If DeepSeek can't judge DeepSeek reliably: Need human or cross-model validation
- If it can: Massive cost savings (use same cheap model for generation + eval)
- If it has specific blind spots: Know when to use human review

### Experiment Design

**Variables (L8):**
1. `generator_model`: DeepSeek R1 vs Haiku (cross-model test)
2. `evaluator_model`: DeepSeek R1 vs Haiku vs GPT-4o-mini
3. `evaluation_rubric`: simple (6 dimensions) vs detailed (8 dimensions)
4. `ground_truth`: none vs human_ratings (validate against human judgment)

**Test Set:** 12 scenes
- 6 generated by DeepSeek R1 (varying quality)
- 6 generated by Haiku (varying quality)
- All human-rated on 0-100 scale by you

**Analysis Matrix:**

| Generator | Evaluator | Correlation with Human | Bias (over/under-rate own work?) |
|-----------|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------------|
| DeepSeek  | DeepSeek  | r = ?                  | +X% bias?                        |
| DeepSeek  | Haiku     | r = ?                  | -Y% bias?                        |
| Haiku     | DeepSeek  | r = ?                  | -Y% bias?                        |
| Haiku     | Haiku     | r = ?                  | +X% bias?                        |

**Metrics:**
- Correlation with human ratings (r-value)
- Score bias (does evaluator over/under-rate generator?)
- False negative rate (misses real issues)
- False positive rate (flags non-issues)

**Hypothesis:**
- DeepSeek over-rates DeepSeek output by 5-10%
- Cross-model evaluation (Haiku→DeepSeek, DeepSeek→Haiku) is more accurate
- Detailed rubric reduces bias
- GPT-4o-mini has highest correlation but costs 10x more

**Actionable Outcomes:**
- ✅ "DeepSeek→DeepSeek: r=0.82, +8% bias (acceptable with correction)"
- ✅ "Haiku→DeepSeek: r=0.89, -2% bias (most accurate)"
- ✅ "Use cross-model eval for final validation (cost: $0.003 vs $0.0009)"
- ✅ "DeepSeek blind spot: Misses repetitive sentence structure 40% of time"

## Experiment 8: Verbalized Sampling - The Diversity Hypothesis

### The Real-World Problem

**Your Challenge:** Generating multiple scene variations for A/B testing or to give writers options.

**Question No One Has Answered:**
> "Does verbalized sampling (generating N reasoning paths, then selecting best) produce more diverse outputs than repeatedly calling the model with temperature variation? Is the diversity-quality trade-off better? And what's the optimal number of reasoning paths (3 vs 5 vs 7)?"

### Why This Matters

- **Verbalized sampling has minimal real-world testing** - this is novel research territory
- Standard approach: Call model 5 times with temp=0.9 → 5 similar outputs
- Verbalized sampling: 1 call with 5 reasoning paths → potentially more diverse
- If verbalized sampling wins: New technique for creative workflows
- Cost implications: 1 call vs N calls

### Experiment Design

**Variables (L8):**
1. `generation_approach`: temperature_variation vs verbalized_sampling
2. `num_samples`: 3 vs 5 (for fair comparison)
3. `selection_method`: best_quality vs random vs ensemble_merge
4. `diversity_prompt`: none vs explicit ("ensure each path explores different creative directions")

**Test Scenario:**
Generate 3 or 5 variations of the same scene outline, then measure:
- **Output diversity**: Cosine similarity between outputs (lower = more diverse)
- **Quality consistency**: Do all outputs meet minimum quality threshold?
- **Selection accuracy**: Does "best" selection yield highest quality?
- **Cost**: API cost per batch

**Implementation:**

*Temperature Variation Approach:*
```
Call 1: temperature=0.8
Call 2: temperature=0.8
Call 3: temperature=0.8
(Total: 3 API calls)
```

*Verbalized Sampling Approach:*
```
Single call with:
"Generate 3 distinct reasoning paths exploring different creative directions.
For each path, draft the scene with a unique approach to [dialogue/pacing/emotion].
Output all 3 drafts."
(Total: 1 API call, but longer output)
```

**Metrics:**

*Diversity Score (0-100):*
- Semantic diversity (40 pts): Avg pairwise cosine distance
- Structural diversity (30 pts): Different scene pacing/structure
- Tonal diversity (30 pts): Different emotional beats

*Quality Consistency (0-100):*
- All outputs above quality threshold (50 pts)
- Standard deviation of quality scores (30 pts)
- Worst output quality (20 pts)

**Analysis:**
- Does verbalized sampling increase diversity vs temperature?
- Does it maintain quality consistency?
- What's the optimal number of reasoning paths?
- Does explicit diversity prompting help?
- Is it cost-effective?

**Hypothesis:**
- Verbalized sampling yields +35% diversity vs temperature variation
- Quality consistency is similar (both approaches work)
- 5 paths is optimal (3 too few, 7 diminishing returns)
- Explicit diversity prompt adds +15% diversity
- Cost: Similar for 3 samples, cheaper for 5+ samples

**Actionable Outcomes:**
- ✅ "Verbalized sampling: +40% diversity, same quality, -30% cost for 5 samples"
- ✅ "Use 5 reasoning paths for best diversity-cost balance"
- ✅ "Explicit diversity prompt essential: +18% semantic diversity"
- ✅ "Ensemble merge yields +8% quality vs best-selection"

**Novel Contribution:**
This experiment fills a gap in the literature. Verbalized sampling is documented for reasoning tasks but **not for creative diversity**. If it works, this becomes a new technique for AI fiction writers.

---

## Special Note: Verbalized Sampling Research

**Why Experiment 8 is High Value:**

Verbalized sampling is documented for:
- ✅ Reasoning tasks (math, logic, coding)
- ✅ Chain-of-thought prompting
- ✅ Improving accuracy on benchmarks

Verbalized sampling is **NOT** documented for:
- ❌ Creative writing diversity
- ❌ Fiction scene generation
- ❌ A/B testing workflows
- ❌ Multi-variant content generation

**If this experiment works**, we'll have:
1. A novel technique for the AI writing community
2. Publishable findings (blog post + academic paper potential)
3. Concrete competitive advantage for TesseractFlow + StoryPunk
4. Real-world validation of generation strategies as experimental variables

**Research Questions:**
