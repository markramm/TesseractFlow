The efficiency is hollow because no actual refinement occurred. The output was not improved despite being in 'single' refinement mode with quality as the focus."

With zero iterations performed, there is no evidence of deliberate stopping decisions or awareness of convergence. The workflow appears incomplete rather than strategically concluded."
